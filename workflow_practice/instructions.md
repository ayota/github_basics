#### INSTRUCTIONS
This is a simple simulation of the workflow to break up all the talking of these first few sessions and because I thought this would be more fun that eleventy billion branching diagrams.

Grab one of the issues in this repo. Each issue corresponds to a piece of code with a (very easy) problem.

1. Set up your virtual env/conda environment/whatever. You do you.
2. Clone the repo onto your local machine.
3. Install requirements.txt
4. Follow procedure to fix your issue.
5. Upload to repo/do the pull request song and dance
6. Merge your PR, etc. into develop.

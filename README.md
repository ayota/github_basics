# fun_3000 workflow basics

### I want to open an issue ...

#### on github
1. Click the green "New Issue" button
2. Give your issue a title and be very descriptive in what the problem and proposed solution is. Include psuedo code and any relevant links because let's face it, we're all going to forget pretty shortly after discussing these things. 
  * If you know there are multiple steps,
   - [ ] << checkboxes are super handy (syntax is ` - [ ] `), and it automagically makes a little progress bar at the bottom of the issue. This and other markdown fanciness are available [here] (https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#links)
3. Add some labels
  * Procedural: "in progress"; "ready for QA"; "not ready yet"
  * Parts of the project
      * "build corpus" refers to anything dealing with amassing text for the corpus
      * "evaluation" refers to the evaluation task
      * "enhancement" is where we've been dumping all the nice-to-haves
  * Don't label anyone "invalid" unless you've talked to them IRL :)
4. Assign some folks
5. We don't really use milestones, but these are another way of organizing things
6. Hit submit
